List and bullets
================

The following code::

    * This is a bulleted list.
    * It has two items, the second
      item uses two lines. (note the indentation)

    1. This is a numbered list.
    2. It has two items too.

    #. This is a numbered list.
    #. It has two items too.

gives:

* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines. (note the indentation)

1. This is a numbered list.
2. It has two items too.

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.

.. note:: if two lists are separated by a blank line only, then the two lists are not differentiated as you can see above.
