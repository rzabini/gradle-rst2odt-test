Headings 
==========

In order to write a title, you can either underline it or under and overline it. The following examples are correct titles. 

.. code-block:: rest

    *****
    Title
    *****

    subtitle
    ########

    subsubtitle
    **********************
    and so on

Two rules: 

  * If under and overline are used, their length must be identical
  * The length of the underline must be at least as long as the title itself

Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the 
structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, it is better to stick to the same convention throughout a project. For instance: 

* `#` with overline, for parts
* `*` with overline, for chapters
* `=`, for sections
* `-`, for subsections
* `^`, for subsubsections
* `"`, for paragraphs
